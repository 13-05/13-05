# Hi!

I'm just some dude who likes to program random shit whenever i feel like it, so don't expect consistency from me lol

# Projects

At the moment, i only have two projects that i've *fully* made (and that i'm proud of and can be considered projects lol); my site `https://13-05.github.io` and my discord bot, `#hash.py`.

I hope you enjoy my projects; both future and past!

# Contact

You can contact me by email at 1305@the-unwelcome.com, but since i don't check email much, use my discord instead. Discord: `Outsider#6969`
