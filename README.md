# Hey!
I'm 1305 on here, but call me Outsider! I'm currently working on [RedPoint](https://github.com/13-05/redpoint), and I enjoy reverse engineering APIs ~~to the extent of inspect element~~ and making them do stuff they aren't supposed to! Here's some stuff I've done on here:

[![my github stats!](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=13-05&show_icons=true&count_private=false&theme=onedark)](https://github.com/13-05)

[![github language stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=13-05&langs_count=4&theme=onedark)](https://github.com/13-05)

## Well, what else do you do?
I've been working with networking a lot more recently, and I particularly love the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (python) and [cpr](https://docs.libcpr.org/) (c++) libraries for making api calls.

## How can I contact you??
