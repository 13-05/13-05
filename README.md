# Hey!
I'm 1305 on here, but call me Outsider! I'm currently working on [Discord.JS-Pure](https://github.com/13-05/discord.js-pure), and I enjoy reverse engineering APIs ~~to the extent of inspect element, i guess lmao~~ and making them do stuff they aren't supposed to! Here's some stuff I've done on here:

[![my github stats!](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=13-05&show_icons=true&count_private=false&theme=onedark)](https://github.com/13-05)

[![github language stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=13-05&langs_count=4&theme=onedark)](https://github.com/13-05)

## Any Cool Projects?
- [Discord.JS-Pure](https://github.com/13-05/discord.js-pure), a Discord selfbot library written in web javascript
- [Hidden Disc Documentation](https://github.com/13-05/hidden-disc-docs), a repository documenting parts of Discord's API they'd rather not talk about

## Anything else?
Contact me through [Discord](https://dsc.bio/outsider1305), and always remember, it's only illegal if you get caught! ;)
